Bugs: 
-Weird tire bursting
-If there are more please let me know.

Unfixable Bugs:
-Interior buttons may appear differently due to ENB's.

Things to know:
-Some exhausts are placed differently to accomodate for the bumpers 
with different exhaust exits. Ruins consistency but allows for a 
better appearance.
-Sometimes the car may fail to spawn on first install. A simple
restart is a possible solution to this and has worked on 
multiple systems.

*gameconfig.xml is only for those who have an unmodified .xml file.
It supports the latest patch as of now (Bikers DLC)
If you already have a modified gameconfig disregard the included 
file.

Installation: 

DO NOT INSTALL the dlc.rpf STRAIGHT FROM WINRAR INTO OpenIV.
This may corrupt the dlc.rpf and crash your game on startup.
Extract dlc.rpf onto desktop and THEN import in openiv. Once
imported into OpenIV, wait, then open the dlc.rpf to make sure 
it's working.
